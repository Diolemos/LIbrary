# Library WebApp

This is an assignment from "The Odin Project"
a library webapp <br/>
Features:
- add books
- remove books
- error handling

I tried following the single responsability and DRY principles

## Future Improvements
- Edit Book Details: Add functionality to edit existing books in the library.
- Search and Filter: Allow users to search and filter books based on title, author, or read status.
- Persistent Storage: Implement local storage to save the library data between sessions.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any suggestions or improvements, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
